      <p class="blog1-start-line">Say Goodbye to Account Hassles</p>
      <p class="blog1-main">
       <a href="https://openai.com/" style=" color:rgb(203 ,213, 225 ); text-decoration-color: #3b82f6;">OpenAI</a> is breaking barriers by making its flagship conversational AI <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" style=" color:rgb(203 ,213, 225 ); text-decoration-color: #3b82f6;">ChatGPT</a>
        accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they have created an
        account. However, while this move enhances accessibility, the experience
        may differ slightly. Importantly, all interactions will continue to
        contribute to the AI's training data unless users actively choose to opt
        out. <br><br>
        <a href="https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly" style=" font-weight: 500; color:rgb(203 ,213, 225 ); text-decoration-color: #3b82f6;">Starting today</a>, in select markets, and gradually expanding
        worldwide, visitors to chat.openai.com will no longer encounter a login
        prompt. Instead, users will be seamlessly immersed in conversation with
        ChatGPT, utilizing the same advanced model as logged-in users. This
        simplification aims to streamline the user experience and encourage
        broader engagement with AI technology. <br><br>
        While users can freely engage in
        conversation, it's essential to note that certain features typically
        associated with persistent accounts, such as saving or sharing chats and
        utilizing custom instructions, may not be available to those without
        accounts. Nevertheless, OpenAI emphasizes the option for users to opt
        out of having their chats contribute to the AI's training data,
        providing a level of control and transparency in the interaction
        process. <br><br>
        You still have the option to opt out of your chats being used for training
        (which, one suspects, undermines the entire reason the company is doing this
        in the first place). Just click the tiny question mark in the lower right-hand 
        side, then click ‚Äúsettings,‚Äù and disable the feature there. 
        Here's a Visual Tutorial through a gif provided  by OpenAI:<br><br>

        More importantly, this extra-free version of ChatGPT will have ‚Äúslightly 
        more restrictive content policies.‚Äù What does that mean? The response we 
        received from the company's representative was long and confusing, lacking 
        any meaningful information: <br>
    <span style="font-weight: 800;">"The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations
        that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful
       content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing 
       additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content 
       that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience.
       <br><br>
       We considered the potential ways in which a logged out service could be used 
       in inappropriate ways, informed by our understanding of the capabilities of 
       GPT-3.5 and risk assessments that we‚Äôve completed."</span>
       <br><br>
       So‚Ä¶ really, no clue as to what exactly these more restrictive policies are.
       We'll soon see as many people visit the site to check out this new offering.
       <span style="font-weight: 800;">‚ÄúWe recognize that additional iteration maybe needed and welcome feedback‚Äù</span>, 
       the representative said.And they shall receive it ‚Äî in abundance!
       <br><br>
       If they had a plan to deal with the likely attempts to misuse the model on a 
       large scale. Running the model is costly, even the improved GPT-3.5 needs a 
       lot of power and server space. People will definitely test its limits.
       <br><br>
       For this threat they also had a wordy non-answer:
       <br><br>
      <span style="font-weight: 800;"> "We‚Äôve also carefully considered how we can detect and stop misuse of the signed 
        out experience, and the teams responsible for detecting, preventing, and responding 
        to abuse have been involved throughout the design and implementation of this experience 
        and will continue to inform its design moving forward."</span>
        <br><br>
        Notice the absence of any solid details. They likely have little clue about 
        what people will throw at this thing, just like everyone else. They'll likely have to 
        react rather than plan ahead.
        <br><br>
        We're not sure who will get early access to ultra-free ChatGPT first, but it's 
        launching today. Keep an eye out to see if you're one of the lucky ones.
