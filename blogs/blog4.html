      <p class="blog1-main">
        I've recently started learning full-stack web development, and it's been
        quite the journey. Just a couple of months ago, I didn't know anything
        about it. Now, I'm building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
        I've even started using libraries like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. It's
        been a rewarding experience, and I'm enjoying every step of the learning
        process. <br><br>

        After my semester ends, I'm planning to dive deeper into the
        field by doing an internship. It'll be a great opportunity to gain
        real-world experience and work on projects alongside seasoned
        professionals. Additionally, I'll be venturing into freelancing on the
        side. This will not only allow me to apply my skills in practical
        scenarios but also provide me with a platform to explore different types
        of projects and expand my portfolio. <br><br>

        Moreover, I'm eager to broaden my
        understanding beyond web development. I have a keen interest in
        application development and ethical hacking. Learning these disciplines
        will not only complement my skills but also open up new avenues for me
        to explore. With each new skill I acquire, I'm one step closer to
        achieving my goals also open up new opportunities for me. <br>
        Here's a look at some projects I've built: <br>
