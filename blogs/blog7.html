        Aiming to bring the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù back to ‚Äúsocial media,‚Äù a new app called
        <a
          class="all-a"
          style="text-decoration-color: #3b82f6"
          href="https://www.thenoplace.com/"
          >noplace</a
        >
        has surged to the top of the App Store as it launched out of invite-only
        mode on Wednesday. Designed to appeal to a younger crowd ‚Äî or anyone who
        wants to connect with friends or around shared interests ‚Äî noplace is
        like a modern-day Myspace. With its colorful, customizable profiles,
        users can share everything from relationship status to what they‚Äôre
        listening to or watching, what they‚Äôre reading or doing, and more.
        <br /><br />
        The app's viral success ahead of its public launch bodes well for its
        potential in the often-difficult consumer social market. Noplace's
        standout feature allows users to express themselves by customizing the
        colors of their profiles, a nostalgic nod to the chaotic customizations
        of Myspace. Although Gen Z may not have grown up with Myspace, there's
        an undeniable appeal in experiencing a social networking platform that
        emphasizes creativity and personalization over uniformity. <br /><br />
        ‚ÄúI think that part of the magical, fun part of the internet is gone now.
        Everything is very uniform,‚Äù says founder and CEO
        <a
          class="all-a"
          style="text-decoration-color: #3b82f6"
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tzhongg/"
          >Tiffany Zhong</a
        >. Previously, Zhong founded her own early-stage consumer fund,
        Pineapple Capital, and,
        <a
          class="all-a"
          style="text-decoration-color: #3b82f6"
          href="https://tzhongg.medium.com/55-things-learned-as-a-19-year-old-vc-6c54af2f0f89"
          >in her teens</a
        >, worked at Binary Capital, helping source early-stage consumer deals.
        With noplace, Zhong aims to revive that lost sense of individuality and
        fun, providing a platform where users can truly express themselves and
        connect over shared interests in a vibrant, personalized space.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img

        <br /><br />
        In the ever-evolving landscape of social apps, Zhong has consistently
        demonstrated a knack for spotting trends. From predicting Musical.ly's
        rise in 2015 to foreseeing shifts in user behavior, her insights into
        what resonates with younger audiences are unparalleled. <br /><br />
        She also often
        <a
          class="all-a"
          style="text-decoration-color: #3b82f6"
          href="https://x.com/tzhongg"
          >tweeted</a
        >
        her product insights and analysis, particularly about consumer apps,
        gaining her a following on social media. Given her background, it‚Äôs no
        surprise that Zhong has well-developed ideas about what might appeal to
        today‚Äôs younger users in a new social networking app. <br /><br />
        "I've always loved social," Zhong reflects. "But nowadays, social media
        feels less about connection and more about consuming content. It's
        become disconnected." <br /><br />
        This disconnect, she believes, stems from the hyper-personalization of
        content. "We're all consuming different things based on our interests,
        which makes finding a true community challenging." <br /><br />
        Enter noplace, Zhong's latest venture aiming to bridge this gap. Unlike
        traditional platforms, noplace isn't just about personal feeds‚Äîit's
        about fostering genuine connections based on shared interests.
        <br /><br />
        At its core, noplace offers a streamlined, customizable profile where
        users can share real-time updates and curate their interests using tags
        known as "stars." Whether it's their astrology sign, Myers-Briggs type,
        hobbies, or fandoms, these stars help users discover like-minded
        individuals in a single space. <br /><br />
        Think of noplace as a global group chat meets Twitter, emphasizing
        text-based updates over photos and videos. It's a deliberate choice to
        prioritize meaningful conversations and shared interests over passive
        consumption. <br /><br />
        And reminiscent of early social networks like Myspace, noplace features
        a "top 10 friends" section, putting emphasis on personal connections
        rather than popularity metrics. <br /><br />
        In a landscape dominated by visual content, noplace dares to redefine
        what it means to be social. It's not just about scrolling through feeds;
        it's about engaging, connecting, and discovering new perspectives‚Äîall in
        one place. <br /><br />
        As Zhong puts it, "noplace isn't just another app. It's a
        community-driven platform designed to bring people closer together
        through shared passions and conversations. It's time social media got
        social again." <br /><br />
        With Zhong's track record and noplace's innovative approach, it's clear
        that the future of social networking might just be a lot more
        personal‚Äîand a lot less about the media.

        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="../images/noplace2.webp"
          class="blog3-gif"
          alt="Tutorial gif"
        /><i style="font-weight: 200; font-size: large"
          >Image Credits: noplace</i
        >
        <br /><br />
        "Facebook, back when I used it in middle school about ten years ago, was
        all about sharing cool updates about life," Zhong reminisces. "We don't
        quite have that anymore, do we? You can follow friends on Instagram, but
        it's mostly highlights, not frequent updates." <br /><br />
        On noplace, the focus is on sharing current activities rather than past
        events. Whether exploring a new city, watching a show, or discovering a
        new band, these become your status updates. The app features two feeds:
        one with updates from your friends and another showcasing global updates
        from all users, both presented in reverse chronological order. There are
        no private profiles, fostering a more open and connected experience.
        <br /><br />
        For users under 18, noplace provides a moderated feed to ensure a safer
        environment. The company has developed an internal moderation dashboard
        and assigned a dedicated team to uphold safety standards. <br /><br />
        "With noplace, we're bringing back the essence of real-time sharing and
        genuine connection," Zhong explains. "It's about staying current with
        what your friends are up to and discovering shared interests with others
        around the world. We're committed to creating a space where everyone can
        feel safe and engaged." <br /><br />
        This approach not only echoes the simplicity and authenticity of early
        social platforms but also addresses the evolving needs of today's
        digital landscape.
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="../images/noplace3.webp"
          class="blog3-gif"

        /><i style="font-weight: 200; font-size: large"
          >Image Credits: noplace</i
        >
        <br /><br />
        Instead of algorithms, noplace leverages AI technology to drive
        suggestions and curation. The app doesn‚Äôt edit the feed for you, but
        rather uses AI to do things like offering summaries of what you‚Äôve
        missed. <br><br> ‚ÄúWe did that intentionally ‚Ä¶ having a global, public feed is
        what makes it so fun. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs brain on paper,‚Äù Zhong notes.
        ‚ÄúPeople have a blast. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never had an app like this
        before.‚Äù <br><br> The Tokyo- and San Francisco-based founder first started
        working on noplace during the second half of last year along with a
        remotely distributed full-time team of seven. Late last year, noplace
        launched into an invite-only beta phase and ‚Äúaccidentally went viral,‚Äù
        Zhong says, prompting the team to distribute some invite codes to early
        adopters, which included some K-pop fans. <br><br> The app is now poised to offer
        younger Twitter users an alternative to the network now known as X under
        Elon Musk, and offers the same ability to post to a text-based feed, but
        combines that with friend-finding features and customization options
        that appeal to their demographic. <br><br> The app is a free download on iOS and
        is available in read-only mode on the web. Monetization plans are not
        yet underway. noplace competes with other friend-finding apps targeting
        Gen Z, like Wizz, Yubo, purp, LMK and others. <br><br> The startup is backed by
        funding from investors including 776 (Alexis Ohanian), Forerunner
        Ventures and others. According to PitchBook data, the company raised $15
        million in a Series A1 round, at a pre-money valuation of $75 million,
        bringing its total raise to north of $19 million.
